Hello there visitor 😁! I am currently studying CyberSecurity 😎. I am always open to trying out new experiences and opportunities and trying out new tools and techniques. I like to play games , watch anime and read books in passtime. 

This is a bloging website where I will try to upload CTF 🏴‍☠️ write ups, project documentation 📃 and talk about new technologies 👨🏿‍💻.
