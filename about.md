Hello there visitor 😁! I'm always open to new opportunities in order to gain experience with unfamiliar tools and techniques, within the realm of cyber. On another note I like to play games , watch anime and read books in my freetime. 

This is a blogging website where I will try to upload CTF 🏴‍☠️ write ups, project documentation 📃 and talk about new technologies 👨🏿‍💻.
